# Portfolio

Hello! My name is Benjamin Freund. Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm a student at Yeshiva University's Katz School of Science and Health, where I'm studying for my MS in Data Analytics and Visualization. I received a BS in business intelligence and marketing analytics, an AA in Jewish Studies, and minors in marketing and psychology from Yeshiva University's Sy Syms School of Business.

I'm dedicated and hard-working, and I see a job to its completion. I know Python, R, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL, Tableau, Microsoft Office, Google Suite, and Minitab Express. I am a fast and eager learner and I'm passionate about what I do.

I love meeting new people and having new experiences. I also love to read books, play pickup sports, and travel.

This portfolio is intended to be a collection of my data analytics projects. I hope you enjoy looking through them, and please feel free to send me any feedback!
